 1) The initial counter value passed through props.


 2) INC and DEC increase and decrease the counter by 1, respectively. There are no limitations, but you can add boundaries of -50/50. When the boundary is reached, nothing happens.


 3) RND changes the counter to a random value between -50 and 50. You can find the code snippet for this easily with a quick search. It is not dependent on the previous state.


 4) RESET resets the counter to 0 or to the initial value from the props. Choose one of the options.
